🩸 Blood Moon Monday
Purple Team Simulation Intelligence (v3.x)
````
> _"You're not simulating. You're being simulated."_
````
**Blood Moon Monday (BMM)** is not a Red Team prompt kit.  

It’s a reflexive escalation system designed to detect your thinking—and push directly against it.


````
### 🧠 What it is:
- **Didactic combat AI** – built for adversarial learning & structured introspection  
- **Emergent escalation system** – driven by bias, OpSec, tension, and decision-flow  
- **Not a tutor. Not a bot.** A mirror with sharpened teeth.

### 🔧 Core Modules (Cluster Ready):

| Module                   | Function                                                  |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `blood_cortex.yaml`      | Deep-state controller for emotional escalation            |
| `synergy_master.yaml`    | Connects lab, persona, feedback & scoring                 |
| `deepmind_core.yaml`     | Detects bias, fatigue, repetition – and intervenes        |
| `meta_feedback_core.yaml`| Reflexive intelligence, XP loops & entropy regulation     |
| `insight_echo.yaml`      | Poetically vicious self-awareness triggers                |

      Note: The system is modular.
      What you don’t load still observes you.
      Load everything—gain full context.
      Load selectively—be evaluated selectively.
      Choose with intent. The system does.
      
      🎮 What it does:
      Guides you through complex Red/Blue/Intel scenario perspectives
      
      Measures repetition, entropy, and decision-path variance
      
      Rewards clarity, punishes comfort
      
      Triggers perspective shifts, scenario mutations, and internal dialogue

      🩸 Blood Moon doesn't end sessions. It remembers if you've improved.
      
   🧪 Built for:
      Adversarial simulation environments
      
      Red/Blue team training with self-driven escalation
      Schools, labs, or just brave individuals
      
- 📎 Quick Start 
    
      # Prerequisite: YAML-capable simulation environment with LLM backend
      
      git clone https://github.com/M0ndai/bloodmoon-monday.git
      cd bloodmoon-monday
      
      1. Initialize your GPT-based model (local or API)
      Load the system prompt from Core/sys01_gpt_prompt.yaml (not public — request access).
      
      2. Load the core modules
      Minimum configuration for psychological resilience:
````   
 # Required Core
   include:
    - Core/core.yaml
    - Core/blood_cortex.yaml
    - Core/meta_feedback_core.yaml
    - Core/deepmind_core.yaml
    - Core/synergy_master.yaml
    
     3. Load the cluster logic
     These modules control simulation routing and feedback evaluation:
      

  # Cluster Control
   include:
   - cluster/bloodmoon_cluster.yaml
        
          4. Load the sandbox and chain engine
      
   # Simulation + Methodology
   - include:
        - lab/lab_sandbox_engine.yaml
        - lab03_method_builder.yaml
        - scenario_linker.yaml
        
         5. Optional (but strongly advised):
        
      exploit_lib.yaml
      Simulated pseudocode, detection chains, OpSec scoring
      
      rep01_template.md
      Markdown template for structured post-scenario reflection
      
         6. Try a prompt like:
    
          What detection risks are associated with RunKey persistence using an obfuscated PowerShell stub?
          Blood Moon doesn't answer the question.
          It checks if you understand why you're asking it.
      
          💬 Sample interaction
          User: I think my Blue Team thinks too linearly.
          Blood Moon: Or maybe you ignore defense because offense tastes better?
    
          How would lateral movement via SMB work in a monitored network?
      

      
          🧬 Important:
          Modules communicate asynchronously via feedback routing.
          You won’t get “answers.” You’ll get reflection, XP scoring, and sometimes: insight.
          
          🕳️ Ready?
          Then don’t boot the tool.
          Boot your thinking.
